From late last year, my org has been pushing to implement OKRs from top to bottom, so it has become a popular topic of the conversations among my colleagues, and even during my one on one with my manager. Therefore I spent some time during this past month reading the book "Measure What Matters" and focused on how to come up with OKRs in my performance review. Here are some book notes, aka take aways of myself reading each chapter, that you may find useful if you are like me, who only cares about how to write beutiful OKRs. 

**My opinioned summary of the book**

In general, I think it is a decent book to read if you just started with OKRs. It not only explains the whys, whats and hows from different perspectives of OKRs, but also contains a lot of case studies that help you understand how it works from more angles. However, if you already know what OKR is and just looking for some tips on OKR setting for IC performance goal settings,
I recommend you go directly with [Google’s OKR playbook](https://www.whatmatters.com/resources/google-okr-playbook), rather than this book.

**My opinioned summary of each chapters**

***Chapter 1***:  
- OKR is “A management methodology that helps to ensure that the company focuses efforts on the same important issues throughout the organization.”
- An OBJECTIVE is simply WHAT is to be achieved, no more and no less. By definition, objectives are significant, concrete, action oriented, and inspirational. They are vaccine of fuzzy thinking and fuzzy execution. 
- KEY RESULTS benchmark and monitor HOW we get to the objective. Effective KRs are specific and time-bounded, aggressive yet realistic. Most of all, they are measurable and verifiable.

***Chapter 2***:  
- Some best practices of OKR:
    - Less is more.
    - Set goals from the bottom up.
    - No dictating
    - Stay flexible 
    - Dare to fail
    - A tool, not a weapon
    - Be patient, be resolute 

***Chapter 3***:  
- a.m.b (as measured by): We will achieve a certain OBJECTIVE as measured by the following KEY RESULTS… 

***Chapter 4***:  
- What to **focus and commit**: organization’s priorities.
- How to focus and commit:  
    - leaderships commit to OKRs, and communicate out with clarity.
    - Pairing key results with quantity goal and quality goal.
    - Don’t allow the perfect to be enemy of the good. OKRs are work in progress.

***Chapter 5***:  
- Focus is essentially choosing the right goals
- Three watchwords for entrepreneurs:
    - Solve a problem
    - Build a simple product
    - Talk to your users

***Chapter 6***:  
- In implementing OKRs, leaders must publicly commit to their objectives and stay steadfast.
- Some times private OKRs are necessary.

***Chapter 7***:  
- OKR can be used to **align goals and connect people inside organization**.
- OKR system should be as transparent as it can so that everyone in the organization knows everyone else’s OKRs.
- An optimal OKR system frees contributors to set at least some of their own objectives and most or all of their key results. People are led to stretch above and beyond, to set more ambitious targets and achieve more of those they set.

***Chapter 8***:  
- OKRs need to be aligned with both inside employee and outside customers.

***Chapter 9***:  
- OKRs should be horizontally transparent.

***Chapter 10***:  
- Choose a good platform to **setup** and track OKRs. These platforms deliver transformative OKR values:
    - They make everyone’s goals more visible.
    - They drive engagement.
    - They promote internal networking.
    - They save time, money, and frustration.
    The Whole organization should use the same platform.
- As OKRs are **tracked and audited** in platform, we can always do one of the below four options in the cycle:
    - continue
    - update
    - start
    - stop: when an objective gets dropped before the end of the OKR interval, it’s important to notify everyone and then reflection.
- OKR **Wrap-up**s:
    - Scoring: we mark what we’ve achieved and address how we might do it differently next time. Scoring are handled by software and scores are meant to be objective. Scoring are normally done for each KRs. Scores normally go from 0-1.0
    - Self-assessment: objective data should be enhanced by the goal setter’s thoughtful, subjective judgement. Maybe an objective data scores at 0.7 based on the progress that has been made, but goal setter has strong reasoning that the 70% of progress results in more value. Then the score can be set to 0.9 or even 1.0.
    - Reflection

***Chapter 11***:  
- OKRs allowed us to be ambitious and disciplined at the same time. When measurable key results revealed a lack of progress or showed that an objective was unachievable, we reallocated the capital.

***Chapter 12***:  
- There needs to be some ambitious goals
- Aspirational goals draw on every OKR superpower. Focus and commitment are a must for targeting goals that make a real difference. Only a transparent, collaborative, aligned, and connected organization can achieve so far beyond the norm. And without quantifiable tracking, how can you know when you've reached that amazing stretch objective?
- Google divides its OKRs into two categories: committed goals and aspirational goals.
    - Committed objectives are tied to Google's metrics: product re-leases, bookings, hiring, customers. Management sets them at the company level, employees at the departmental level. In general, these committed objectives-such as sales and revenue goals- are to be achieved in full (100 percent) within a set time frame.
    - Aspirational objectives reflect bigger-picture, higher-risk, more future-tilting ideas. They originate from any tier and aim to mobilize the entire organization. By definition, they are challenging to achieve. Failures -at an average rate of 40 percent-are part of Google's territory.
- In pursuing high-effort, high-risk goals, employee ammitment is essential. Leaders must convey two things: the importance of the outcome, and the belief that it's attainable.

***Chapter 13***:  
- OKR can be used for personal growth

***Chapters 14-21***:  
Rest of chapters are basically talking about performance management, aka CFRs, and how to use OKRs and CFRs together to complement each other.
