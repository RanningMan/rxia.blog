## Overview

For most engineers in early-mid career like me, becoming a senior level engineer is their main goal in the first 5 - 10 years of our career. If you are not one of us, I encourage you to join us and to reach senior level as soon as possible. Why? Besides better pay and nicer-looking title, performing at senior level also provides more oppotunities to make bigger individual impact, solve more challenging problems, and achieve larger accompliment. In short, it is more fun performing at senior level than SDE1/2.

There are tons of tutorials, books, blogs on the internet, that are full of instructions, recommendations, and "helpful" links. And of course, this blog series is yet another one! BUT, what this one different from the other ones is that the main goal of this series is rather to document my personal growth and help myself grow furthuer as a senoir engineer than to teach other people become a senior engineer. I expect audience of this blog can learn from my experience, my success, and my failure, so that you can find your own path to senior level.

## What Does a Senior Software Engineer Mean?

A senior software engineer is typically required to work with and lead a team of software engineers. Hence, skills in leadership, communication, project management and bussiness thinking plays a big role in a senior engineer's day-to-day job. Even though senior software engineers work with a team, they should be able to handle projects at an independent level as well and work alone if required. Thus, excellent system design and architect skills, good knowledge of software engineering best practice, and exceptional coding skills are still required.

## About This Blog Series

This blog series shares what I learned in this past few years in both technical and soft skills while I was pushing hard toward senior level. I will start with technical skills and knowledge, since it is the easy part; then later in this year, I will share some learnings in developing soft skills. For technical part, since I'm most recently working in web development a lot, the tech stack will be HTML + CSS + JS + TS + React.
